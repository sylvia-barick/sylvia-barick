## About Me

I am a **Computer Science undergraduate specializing in AI & Machine Learning**, driven by curiosity and a strong desire to build technology that actually matters.  
My interests lie at the intersection of **AI systems, scalable web platforms, and decentralized technologies**.

Rather than limiting myself to theory, I focus heavily on **hands-on development**, live projects, and hackathons where ideas are tested under real constraints.

What defines my approach:
- Constantly experimenting with AI, ML, Agentic AI, and modern full-stack tools  
- Strong inclination towards product-focused engineering and user-centric design  
- Actively exploring domains like mental wellness technology and intelligent systems  
- Enjoy solving complex bugs and edge cases that most people avoid
